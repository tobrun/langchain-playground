# Langchain Playground

This repository is dedicated to the exploration and experimentation with [Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction), a framework designed for creating applications powered by language models.

## Getting Started

- [Installation Guide](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/installation)
- [Quickstart Tutorial](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/quickstart)

## Features

- **Context-aware Applications**: Connect a language model to various context sources.
- **Reasoning Capabilities**: Utilize language models for reasoning based on provided context.
- **Modular Components**: Abstractions for interacting with language models.
- **Off-the-shelf Chains**: Pre-built assemblies for specific higher-level tasks.

## Modules

- **Model I/O**: Interface with language models.
- **Retrieval**: Interface with application-specific data.
- **Chains**: Construct sequences of calls.
- **Agents**: Manage tool selection within chains.
- **Memory**: Persist application state across chain runs.
- **Callbacks**: Log and stream intermediate steps of any chain.
