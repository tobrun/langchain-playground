    "Agents use a LLM to determine which actions to take. An action can either be a tool and observing the output,\n",
    "or returning a response to the users. Below a list of agents availlable in LangChain:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Zero-shot ReAct: uses the ReAct framework to determine which tool to use based on tool descriptions. (most general purpose agent)\n",
    "- Structured input ReAct: capable of using multi-input tools. \n",
    "- OpenAI Functions: models have been fine-tuned to detect when a function should be called and respond with the inputs that should be passed.\n",
    "- Conversational: used in conversational settings. The prompt makes the agent helpfull and conversational (uses ReAct for tool selection and has memory)\n",
    "- Self-ask with search: uses a tool called Intermediate-Answer. Factual lookup answers to questions.\n",
    "- ReAct document store: requires a search tool and a lookup tool. "
