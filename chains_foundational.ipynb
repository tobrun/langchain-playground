To solve this problem, we can use the fact that prime numbers are only divisible by themselves and 1, so any prime number greater than 40 that is divisible by 3 must also have a remainder of 1 when divided by 3. This means that the number must be congruent to 1 modulo 3, which in turn means that the number must be of the form 3k+1, where k is an integer. Starting with k=1, we get 3*1+1=4, which is not prime, so we try k=2: 3*2+1=7, which is prime, and one plus this number (7+1=8) is divisible by 3. Therefore, the first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3 is 7.\n"
